- **GameState**: Overall game state structure

## üéØ Game Flow

### 1. Setup Phase
1. Players enter names (1-4 players)
2. Timer duration is set
3. Game validation and start

### 2. Playing Phase (Per Player)
1. **Turn Initialization**:
   - Fresh teddies generated
   - Timer reset
   - Score reset to 0
   - Claw repositioned

2. **Gameplay Loop**:
   - Arrow keys move claw
   - Space/Enter drops claw
   - Collision detection for teddy catching
   - Space/Enter releases teddy in sink
   - Score increments on successful drops

3. **Turn End Conditions**:
   - Timer reaches 0
   - All teddies collected (early completion)

### 3. Results Phase
- All player scores compared
- Rankings assigned (with tie handling)
- Winner(s) announced
- Option to play again

## üéÆ Game Mechanics

### Controls
- **Arrow Keys**: Move claw (left/right/up/down)
- **Space/Enter**: Drop claw or release teddy

### Scoring System
- Each teddy successfully dropped in sink = +1 point
- Individual scores per player
- Rankings based on total teddies caught

### Turn Management
- Each player gets independent turns
- Complete state reset between players
- Fresh teddies for each player
- Individual timers

### Responsive Design
- Game area adapts to screen size
- Mobile-friendly controls
- Adaptive teddy count based on screen width

## üîÑ State Management

### Player State
- Individual scores tracked per turn
- Turn-based progression
- Complete isolation between players

### Game State
- Setup ‚Üí Playing ‚Üí Results flow
- Player queue management
- Timer synchronization

### Component State
- Local state for immediate game interactions
- Props drilling for shared data
- Callback functions for state updates

## üöÄ Performance Considerations

### Optimizations
- `useCallback` for expensive functions
- `useEffect` dependency optimization
- Component memoization where needed
- Efficient re-rendering patterns

### Responsive Features
- Dynamic game area sizing
- Adaptive component scaling
- Mobile-first design approach

This architecture ensures a smooth, multiplayer experience with proper turn management, state isolation, and responsive design across all devices.
